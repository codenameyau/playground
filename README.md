# playground

Playground is an object-oriented Three.js boilerplate. Three.js projects
have a lot of boilerplate code that quickly becomes tedious to write.
Additionally as these projects grow, they become difficult to understand and
maintain. Playground attempts to solve those issues by providing a core
library that handles all the behind-the-scenes Three.js setup and rendering code.

Please see the [public example](https://github.com/codenameyau/playground/blob/master/public/assets/js/demo.js)
for basic usage. Please visit [Tribble](https://github.com/codenameyau/tribble/tree/master/public/projects/demo)
for more in-depth demos.
