# playground

Playground is an object-oriented Three.js boilerplate. Three.js projects
have a lot of boilerplate code that quickly becomes tedious to write.
Additionally as these projects grow, they become difficult to understand and
maintain. Playground attempts to solve those issues.

Please see the example in the `public/`.

## Installation
```
bower install playground --save
```

## Features

This project is bundled with many commonly-used public methods and utilities.
Some of these features include:

- Clock pausing and resuming on tab-switching.
- Manually pause the renderer with the 'space' key.
- Reset the camera with the 'r' key.
- Fully customizable key-bindings.
- Dynamically load and reset scenes.
- Automatic window resize.

## Contributing
Please work with `public/assets/js/lib/playground.js`. The files inside
`build/` should not be edited since they are autogenerated with gulp.
