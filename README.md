# playground

Playground is an object-oriented Three.js boilerplate. Three.js projects
have a lot of boilerplate code that quickly becomes tedious to write.
Additionally as these projects grow, they become difficult to understand and
maintain. Playground attempts to solve those issues by providing a core
module that handles all the behind-the-scenes Three.js renderer code.

Please see the [public example](https://github.com/codenameyau/playground/blob/master/public/assets/js/demo.js)
for basic usage. Please visit [Tribble](https://github.com/codenameyau/tribble) for more in-depth demos.

## Installation
```
bower install playground --save
```

## Features

Some features include:

- Clock pausing and resuming on tab-switching.
- Manually pause the renderer with the 'space' key.
- Reset the camera with the 'r' key.
- Fully customizable key-bindings.
- Dynamically load and reset scenes.
- Automatic window resize.

## Contributing
Please work with `public/assets/js/lib/playground.js`. The files inside
`build/` should not be edited since they are autogenerated with gulp.
