# playground

Playground is an object-oritened Three.js boilerplate. Three.js projects
have a lot of boilerplate code that quickly becomes tedious to write.
Additionally as these projects grow, they become difficult to understand and
maintain. Playground attempts to solve those issues.

Please see the example in the `public/`.
